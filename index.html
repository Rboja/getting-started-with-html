            <ul>
              <li>Systematic process of relentlessly idtentifing the cause of a computer<br>
                program that doesnt work. When a computer doesn't work it's because <br>
                there is a mistake (bug) somewhere in the computer code. Since these<br>
                mistakes are unavoiable, programmers usually have a system on fixing <br>
                the problem. Usually the system looks a little like this:
                <ol><em>
                  <li>Collect Evidence (What makes the program fail)</li>
                  <li>Generate Theories (What could've causd the problem)</li>
                  <li>Test Theories (If theory is correct, how do I find out)</li>
                  <li>Fix the Problem (Git-R-Done)</li>
                </ol></em>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>Comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to <br>
                understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and <br>
                bad at. A computer is a tool, as are the programs we use and the <br>
                programming languages used to write them. It's almosyt impossible to <br>
                program anything substantial without a basic understanding of how these <br>
                tools work.

            <ul>
              <li>System Thinkin happens when you break a big problem down into smaller<br>
                pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan(often on paper) for <br>
                how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision <br>
                making about a problem and how different prieces of a program can work<br>
                together to solve it.

            <ul>
